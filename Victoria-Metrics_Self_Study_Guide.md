## Prerequisites and Skills Required

### Prerequisites
1. **Basic understanding of time-series data**  
   Time-series data is a sequence of data points indexed in time order. Familiarity with concepts like timestamps and trends is essential.  
   **Resource:** [What is Time Series Data?](https://estuary.dev/blog/time-series-data-complete-guide/)  

2. **Knowledge of Linux or Unix systems**  
   Since Victoria Metrics is often deployed on Linux-based systems, familiarity with basic Linux commands and shell scripting is important.  
   **Resource:** [Linux Command Line Basics](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners)  

3. **Knowledge of Prometheus and PromQL**  
   Victoria Metrics is compatible with PromQL. Understanding Prometheus and its query language will be helpful.  
   **Resource:** [Prometheus Documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)  

4. **Basic networking and system administration skills**  
   Knowledge of networking concepts like ports, firewalls, and system administration basics will aid in setting up and troubleshooting.
